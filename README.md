# trivia-game-homework

# Aside from classic animation wipes and transitions, I wanted to emulate some of the UI and transitions from beer and pretzel style trivia games  such as BW3's Buzztime trivia and some of the Jackbox games.

# Things I could improve on:
# 
# -Better mobile responsiveness (this would be fun on a tablet)
# -MORE QUESTIONS
# -A smarter difficulty mechanism (the one that's in works, but is kind of ugh)
# -Shareable results
# -Sound effects/music on the question result page
# -Better transistions (fade-ins and outs or popping off the page) for text between questions and answers
# -Get that numerical cell at the end of the timer bar to display the way I wanted
